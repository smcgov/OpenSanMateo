INTRODUCTION
------------
OpenPublic is a Drupal-based content management system (CMS) born from a decade
of work building secure, scalable, transparent websites for all sectors of
government. It is a community-driven platform supported by a network of
innovative open source contributors committed to Open Government.

OpenPublic was built for the public sector, but is not limited in any way as to
who can or should use it. The features and content types are built to meet the
common needs of government agencies, organizations, municipalities, and states,
but OpenPublic is regularly used to create sites too for nonprofit
organizations, foreign governments, and other initiatives. 

INSTALLATION
------------

OpenPublic is available as a full drupal site in tgz and zip format at:

  http://drupal.org/project/openpublic


If building for development (e.g. git version), fetch the contrib modules/libraries via:

drush make --prepare-install build-openpublic.make INSTALL_PATH

DEVELOPING WITH
---------------

For ease of deployment, features (included) and features override
(https://drupal.org/project/features_override) are recommended so configuration
overrides are kept in code also.

Omega tools (https://www.drupal.org/project/omega_tools) may also be useful for
exporting theme settings.
