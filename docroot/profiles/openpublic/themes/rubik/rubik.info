; Rubik does not utilize any of the standard theme features, such as logo,
; favicon, user pictures for nodes/comments, etc. If the "features[]" item is
; left empty, Drupal will automatically display all default theme settings,
; which are completely ignored and not used by Rubik.
; 
; This makes it confusing for administrators because those fields can be
; configured in the admin, but have no effect.
; 
; Leaving the "features[]" key empty will prevent all of those default features
; to be displayed and only the fieldset with custom theme settings defined in
; theme-settings.php file will be shown.
